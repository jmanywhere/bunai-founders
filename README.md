# Bunny AI Founders Claim page

This page is meant for all Founder's NFT holders to claim their rewards collected by the BUNAI trades.

## Considerations

This is a simple Single Page Dapp. Hosting will happen on Vercel due to simplicity.
DNS is provided by the [bunnyai.app](https://bunnyai.app) dev team.

## Usage

In order to use this page:

1. First you'll need to connect your wallet to the page.
2. Make sure your wallet holds any of the [Bunny AI Founders NFT](https://etherscan.io/address/0xbb520ce73fd6e3f5777f583705db081ba3dd65ac) - [Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/bunny-ai-founder-nfts)
3. Once connected, the page will automatically get all the NFT ID's you own and calculate your rewards.
4. In order to claim rewards, you will need to approve BUNAI for the contract to BURN. (DO NOT BURN BEFORE OR ON YOUR OWN). Each claim requires a BURN of _initially_ 100 BUNAI.
